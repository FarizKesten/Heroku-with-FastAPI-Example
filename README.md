# Heroku-with-FastAPI-Example
Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI

# EDA.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook that works with the raw consensus data and save them to consensus_clean.csv

# DVC

DVC is used to save the consensus data and is saved to a S3 bucket

# Model Training
A model will be trained based on the cleaned up dataset and a LabelBinarizer(lb.joblib) & OneHotEncoder(encoder.joblib) will be saved
